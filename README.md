I found more difficult than i originally imagined. Worked alone as I didn't know anyone from class to group up with.
I wrote a simpler code for the AI. My attempt at StateMachines was taking up too much time.
I learned/got a better understanding of movement with Vectors. I tended to use a rigidbody with input controls

I'm not proud of this project
